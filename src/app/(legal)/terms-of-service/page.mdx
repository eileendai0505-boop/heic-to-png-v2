# Terms of Service

**Effective Date: December 17, 2025**

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the HeicToPng.org website (the "Service") operated by HeicToPng ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

HeicToPng.org provides a web-based utility that allows users to convert image files from the HEIC (High Efficiency Image Coding) format to PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format. The Service utilizes Client-Side Processing technology, meaning that conversions are executed within the user's web browser environment using the device's local processing power.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) at any time with or without notice to you, and we will not be liable to you or to any third party should we exercise such rights.

## 3. Intellectual Property Rights

### 3.1. Our Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of HeicToPng.org and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of HeicToPng.org.

### 3.2. Your Intellectual Property (User Content)

We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your files remain yours.

- **Ownership**: You retain full ownership and copyright of any HEIC files you convert and the resulting PNG files.
- **License**: Since we do not upload your files to our servers, you do not need to grant us a license to host, store, or reproduce your content, unlike server-side converters. The conversion process is technical and ephemeral, occurring strictly on your hardware.

## 4. User Conduct and Prohibited Uses

You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes. You are strictly prohibited from using the Service:

1. **Illegal Activities**: In any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local, or international law or regulation (including, without limitation, any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the US or other countries).
2. **Harm to Minors**: For the purpose of exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way by exposing them to inappropriate content or otherwise.
3. **Malware**: To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material, including any "junk mail", "chain letter," "spam," or any other similar solicitation.
4. **Interference**: To impersonate or attempt to impersonate HeicToPng.org, a HeicToPng.org employee, another user, or any other person or entity.
5. **Reverse Engineering**: To attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce to human-perceivable form any of the source code used in providing the Service.
6. **Scraping**: To use any robot, spider, or other automatic device, process, or means to access the Service for any purpose, including monitoring or copying any of the material on the Service.
